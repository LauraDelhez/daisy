TODO ---things that needs to be done with Daisy -*- outline -*-

* Now

** Maja kommentarer

** Stathis paper

** Build Daisy

* RAINPROOF

** Sensitivity

*** Multiple tiers

**** Observed data

**** Calibrated data

**** Simulated data

**** Generated data

**** NNW / RAINPROOF model data

*** RAINPROOF vs Observed data

Compare predicted (by RAINPROOF) M with measurements.
--> May be difficult because of time resolution
--> We will only have observations for a single application day

*** RAINRPOOF vs Calibrated data : Validation

We should go more in depth using our validation and optimization sites
-> We get the time resolution we want.
-> We can use additional application days

*** RAINRPOOF vs Simulated data

We may take additional well described soils from the database, or we
can extend the calibrated soils with additional weather and management.

*** RAINPROOF vs Generated data

Basically what Jeanne does with her training and test datasets.

*** RAINPROOF vs RAINPROOF

Compare sensitivety of RAINPROOF predictions.  Feed it two set of data,
and see the difference.

*** Test how much the performance of RAINPROOF degrades with random data

Crop, subsoil, topsoil, lower boundary, forecast (n days), historical
weather, product

For categorical features we can pick the others.

For static features, we can choose at random from another generated
soil.

For historical weather and forecast, we can pick a random other year
same climate.

All of these are extremes, only really provides information if the
degradation is minor.

*** Test how much the performance of RAINPROOF degrades with coarse data

Simulate specific well described fields. Look up the fields in
database (or translate to "soil class"). How much worse is RAINPROOF
feed with the "coarse" soil, instead of the "detailed" soil?

*** Test how much performace decrease with actual forecast

Unfortuntely, we only have one year. However, we can try different different soils, products, crops, and lower boundaries.

** OM init

* Skyethed med timeværdier?

* Ny version af Hypres ark

* Ny version af Charlottes afdræningstest.

* Tidlig vækst

Erstat DSLAI05 med Seed baseret tidlig vækst. Søren havde en formel,
men vi skal have en test setup.

* Regression test

* Daisy problemer

** DMI's nye "nedbørskorrigering"

** Ny ligning for biopore til matrix flow fra Søren

** Brug massebalance til at udregne (vertical) flux fra bunden.

Husk drænnoder!
